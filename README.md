## SWOT Analysis

### Strengths:

I feel much more confident going into this than I did in Unit 1.

### Weaknesses:

My weakness would probably be the routing aspect and thinking of names for my code.

### Opportunities:

I'm gonna use this week to cement my knowledge of React and look into using a component library to style my app.

### Threats:

My biggest threat is me getting sidetracked or restarting my code because I want to make it better/more efficent.
