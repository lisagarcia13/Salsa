## API and Data Sample

Show us a snippet of JSON returned by your Airtable (you can find it under the API documentation) so we know you can access it and get the info you need. This **must** be properly formatted. An example is below:

```json
{
    "id": "reclAzUAE3RPlSp8e",
    "fields": {
      "name": "Pico De Gallo",
      "description": "New take on classic recipe",
      "ingredients": "- 2 Roma tomatoes\n- 1 Large Hass Avocado\n- 1 Cilantro bunch\n- 1 Serrano pepper\n- 1/2 oz freshly squeezed lime\n- 1/2 White onion\n",
      "steps": "1. Dice Roma tomatoes to small cubes.\n2. Chop cilantro finely\n3. Cut avocados in half and remove seed. Make sure they're cubed\n4. Grab onion and dice ...",
      "Rating": 2
    }
```

### MVP/PostMVP

The functionality will then be divided into two separate lists: MVP and PostMVP. Carefully decide what is placed into your MVP, as the client will expect this functionality to be implemented upon project completion.

#### MVP

_These are examples only. Replace with your own MVP features._

- Find and use external api
- Render data on page
- Allow user to choose favorites

#### PostMVP

_These are examples only. Replace with your own Post-MVP features._

- Add second API
- Use local storage to save user favorites

## Project Schedule

## Timeframes

Tell us how long you anticipate spending on each area of development. Be sure to consider how many hours a day you plan to be coding and how many days you have available until presentation day.

Time frames are also key in the development cycle. You have limited time to code all parts of your app. Your estimates can then be used to evalute possibilities based on time needed and the actual time you have before the app must be submitted. It's always best to pad the time by a few hours so that you account for the unknown so add an additional hour or two to each component to play it safe. Throughout your project, keep track of your Time Invested and Actual Time and update your README regularly.

| Component        | Priority | Estimated Time | Time Invested | Actual Time |
| ---------------- | :------: | :------------: | :-----------: | :---------: |
| Adding Form      |    H     |      3hrs      |    3.5hrs     |   3.5hrs    |
| Working with API |    H     |      3hrs      |    2.5hrs     |   2.5hrs    |
| Total            |    H     |      6hrs      |     5hrs      |    5hrs     |
